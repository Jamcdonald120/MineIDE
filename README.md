# MineIDE
MineIDE is an IDE that is designed to make developing complex minecraft command block chains easier by adding 
standard programing control structures and features in such a way that the final product can be compiled down
into individual command blocks and redstone circuts that can be imported in to an existing world via
a single command block, a structure block, or a schimatic file
